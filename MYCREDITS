I created this document to special thank many people who helped me with their github repositories, these people are :

Faux123 : https://github.com/faux123 -> This guy is a genius, for sure.
ChangYeoun : https://github.com/ChangYeoun -> The first who started developing for Optimus G Stock Kernel.
Francisco Franco : https://github.com/franciscofranco -> He's a boss, nothing else to say.
Showp1984 (Dennis Rassmann) : https://github.com/showp1984 -> He made IMHO the best Sweep2Wake and Doubletap2Wake Implementations available, he deserves respect.
